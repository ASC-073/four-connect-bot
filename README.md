# four-connect-bot
The project was part of the course Artificial Intelligence (CS F407), entirely using Python. Various evaluation functions were tried out to minimise the number of moves taken by the bot to win and win rate. Move ordering heuristic was implemented along with Alpha-Beta pruning to improve efficiency.
